 * Set of http methods.

 * HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the purpose of the request and what is expected if the
 * request is successful. Although they can also be nouns, these request methods are sometimes referred to
 * as HTTP verbs. Each request method has its own semantics, but some characteristics are shared across multiple
 * methods, specifically request methods can be safe, idempotent, or cacheable.
