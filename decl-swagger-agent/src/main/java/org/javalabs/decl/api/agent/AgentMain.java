/**
 * The java agent can be attached to a VM either during JVM startup, or after
 * the startup.
 *
 * To attach the agent during bootstrap, one has to specify, the following
 * option in the startup script: -javaagent:/path/to/agent.jar=argumentstring
 *
 * Often it is not desired to stop a VM. In that case the java agent has to be
 * loaded on the fly. This is done with the help of {@link AgentLoader}.
 * {@link AgentLoader} has the ability to connect to an already running java
 * process, and push the tiny agent to that process.
 *
 * JavaAgentMain has to primary methods: 1. premain - This method will be
 * invoked during bootstrap. 2. agentmain - This method will be invoked after an
 * agent is pushed to a running process.
 *
 * Once the agent is loaded into the process JVM, it will start the
 * instrumentation. It uses javassist for byte code instrumentation. If the
 * remote process does not have the javassist library (jar) in it's classpath,
 * then it's classpath will be modified (via the {@link URLClassLoader}) to
 * include the library path, thus enabling it perform the instrumentation.
