 * Interface to represent a http web server.

 * <p>
 * A web server is a runtime that accepts requests via HTTP or its secure variant HTTPS.
 * On the software side, a web server includes several parts that control how web users access
 * hosted files. At a minimum, this is an HTTP server. An HTTP server is software that understands
 * URLs (web addresses) and HTTP (the protocol your browser uses to view webpages).
 * An HTTP server can be accessed through the domain names of the websites it stores, and it
 * delivers the content of these hosted websites to the end user's device.
