/**
 * Configuration file for starting up the container.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The configuration file of a container has the following kep aspects:
 * 
 * <ul>
 *   <li>URL Mapping - It defines how incoming URLs are mapped to specific handlers or other 
 *       resources within the vert.x application.</li>
 *   <li>Access Control - Configuration files can define security constraints, specifying which 
 *       users or roles have access to specific resources.</li>
 *   <li>Resource Allocation - The configuration can control resource allocation like thread pools 
 *       and connection pools for optimal performance.</li>
 *   <li>Context Parameters - Parameters defined in the configuration file can be used by the vert.x
 *       application for various purposes, such as setting database connection details or other 
 *       environment-specific settings.</li>
 *   <li>Custom Properties - Some containers allow defining custom properties to configure specific 
 *       aspects of the container's behavior beyond the standard settings.</li>
 * </ul>
