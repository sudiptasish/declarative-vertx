     * 1. If the system property <code>org.javalabs.decl.container.spi.HttpServerProvider</code> is defined

     * 
     * 2. If a provider class has been installed in a jar file that is visible to the system class loader, 
     *    and that jar file contains a provider-configuration file named org.javalabs.decl.container.spi.HttpServerProvider
     *    in the resource directory META-INF/services, then the first class name specified in that file is taken. 
     *    The class is loaded and instantiated; if this process fails then an unspecified unchecked error 
     *    or exception is thrown.
     * 
     * 3. Finally, if no provider has been specified by any of the above means then the system-default 
     *    provider class is instantiated and the result is returned.
     * 
     * Subsequent invocations of this method return the provider that was returned by the first invocation.
