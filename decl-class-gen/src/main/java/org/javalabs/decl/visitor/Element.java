 * A Visitor design pattern consists of several key components that work together to enable its functionality.
 * This interface defines an accept method that takes a visitor as an argument. This method allows the visitor
 * to visit the concrete elements.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Concrete classes implement the Element interface and represent the various types of objects in the structure.
 * Each concrete element defines how it accepts a visitor by calling the corresponding method on the visitor.
