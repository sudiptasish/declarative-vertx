/**
 * A command represents a unit of work to be performed, whose purpose is to examine
 * and/or modify the state of a {@link Context}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Multiple commands are assembled into a {@link Chain}, which allows them to either
 * complete the required processing or delegate further processing to the next 
 * {@link SyncCommand} in the {@link Chain}.
 * 
 * Commands are loosely coupled. A command either succeeds or fails. A command
 * has the {@link #execute(org.javalabs.decl.workflow.Context) } method that will be
 * called by the workflow chain once it is activated. If the command execution is
 * successful, then it will return <code>true</code> indicating the next command
 * to initiate the next processing step. If any of the command execution fails, the
 * chain will invoke the {@link #backtrack(org.javalabs.workflow.Context) } API,
 * which will start rollbacking the work already done by the previous set of command(s).
 * The backtracking feature can be disabled via a flag. Because it may be possible
 * that some command has done persistence to some storage or db, which cannot be
 * rollbacked. Hence by default the backtracing will be disabled.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A {@link Chain} does not handler exceptions originating from a command.
 * It is therefore recommended that the individual command must do their exception
 * handling. Returning any {@link RuntimeException} may have an impact on the
 * current workflow execution.
